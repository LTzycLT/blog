Due to the demand of removing similar articles in Touchpal Dialer's feeds, I did some research on related algorithms and realized a few of them.
I will tell about three of them in this article.

* The well-known simhash[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimHash], 
* minhash[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash]
* lshforest[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LSHForest.html]

### simhash
Simhash is a wellknown algorithm which is applyied by Google in its similar webpage detection.

### minhash
pass

### LSHForest
The first time I saw this name is when I was browsing the guideline of sklearn.
